## Final project－Optimization of Restaurant Logistics Delivery Routes

In order to reduce the delivery cost, finding the shortest path between each point is crucial for the operator. Hence, this project aims to identify 16 restaurants and determine the shortest delivery route among them. The distances between restaurants will be calculated using the actual road distances from Google Maps. This problem can be considered as a combinatorial optimization problem.

### Heuristic Algorithms
Four heuristic algorithms, namely Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Simulated Annealing (SA), were employed to solve the problem.

### Parameter Experiment Design
The parameters for each algorithm were set using a full factorial experimental design method. Additionally, each algorithm was executed 100 times to ensure stability.

### Optimization Results

Both Simulated Annealing and Ant Colony Optimization algorithms achieved the optimal solution for the problem. However, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm demonstrated the fastest convergence time.

### Result Analysis

The Ant Colony Optimization algorithm exhibited the best effectiveness and consistency. It almost consistently reached the optimal solution in all of the 100 experiments, converging at iteration 100 each time. This indicates that the algorithm performed well and showed relative stability for this specific problem.
