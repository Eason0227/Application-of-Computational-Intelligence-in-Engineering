## Final project－Optimization of Restaurant Logistics Delivery Routes

In order to reduce the delivery cost, finding the shortest path between each point is crucial for the operator. Hence, this project aims to identify 16 restaurants and determine the shortest delivery route among them. The distances between restaurants will be calculated using the actual road distances from Google Maps. This problem can be considered as a combinatorial optimization problem.
